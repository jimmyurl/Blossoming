### **App Overview: Blossoming**

**Purpose:**
Blossoming is a Flutter-based mobile app designed to capture and manage images with associated metadata. The app includes features for capturing images using the device’s camera or selecting images from the gallery. Users can also add metadata to each image.

**Key Features:**

1. **Image Capture:**
   - Users can take photos using the device’s camera.
   - Alternatively, users can select images from their device's gallery.

2. **Metadata Input:**
   - After capturing or selecting an image, users can enter text-based metadata such as flower type or location related to the image.
   - This metadata helps in categorizing or providing context for the image.

3. **Image Display:**
   - Display the captured or selected image on the screen.
   - Allow users to view the image along with the metadata input field.

4. **Image Management:**
   - Provide options to clear the current image and metadata.
   - Ensure that the image and metadata fields are reset when required.

5. **Timed Cadence (if implemented):**
   - Automatically capture images at a timed interval (e.g., one image per second) using the device’s camera.
   - This feature would require additional setup for handling periodic tasks and capturing images in the background.
